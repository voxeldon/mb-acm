# User Guide

To activate the addon, you have two options:

1. **Crafting the ACM Tool**: Surround a dirt block with wooden planks in your crafting area to create the ACM Tool.
2. **Using a Script Command**: Enter the command `/scriptevent acm:give` in the game's chat to directly obtain the ACM Tool.

Once you have the ACM Tool, use it once to initialize the addon. Use it again to access the addon's configuration menu.

Alternatively, you can utilize the following script events for various functions:

- `acm:help` - Displays a list of available commands.
- `acm:start` - Initializes and starts the ACM addon.
- `acm:tool` - Provides the ACM Tool to the player who executed the command.
- `acm:show` - Opens the ACM configuration menu.

Within the configuration menu, there's a specific subsection for the Config Manager. Here, you can assign a tag to restrict access to the menu, which is highly recommended for multiplayer environments such as servers and realms, to prevent unauthorized access.
